# UFO_Sighting

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to expand upon Danaâ€™s webpage and dynamic table and try to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, users will also be able to filter the table for the city, state, country, and shape. These filters can be used individually or all together if one wishes, making it a very useful tool when trying to find a specific incident.

## Results 

The first photo is created by inputting 1/2/2010 in for the date parameter for searching up in the data.js file for any UFO sightings that occured on that specific day, with the second photo also requiring that the incident happened in California.

With these five search criteria, there are a plethora of ways that a person is able to search the database for a UFO sighting that fits what they're looking for.

## Summary

One drawback of the website is that it only uses the data.js file for the possible instances that it can reference, instead of being able to work with a larger database. Another potential problem that this creates is that users are unable to enter their own incidents, which would definitely be able to help with the website database. A second solution to help with the website it to allow for more search criteria, such as by a specific word in the comments of the incident, which could really encourage people to be more specific in how they describe their incidents.
